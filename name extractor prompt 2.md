To update the prompt according to the new requirement, we need to incorporate the instruction to split the names and qualifications based on their position relative to the keyword "previous." The updated prompt will guide the user to separate the entries into two distinct parts, "BEFORE_PREVIOUS" and "AFTER_PREVIOUS," and format them accordingly in the JSON structure. Here's how the updated prompt could look:

---

**Input Text:** `[INPUT TEXT]`

Carefully analyze the provided text to extract names along with their academic qualifications, ensuring to exclude any affiliations with universities or colleges. The text contains a keyword "previous" that serves as a delimiter to separate the entries into two parts: those appearing before and after the keyword. Retain the original formatting and spelling of each name as it appears in the input. Utilize the placeholders and template provided below to format the extracted names and qualifications according to the specified JSON structure, which is designed to accommodate multiple entries. Ensure each name and its corresponding qualification are correctly formatted and inserted into the JSON template under the appropriate section, either before or after the "previous" keyword. Confirm that the final JSON output is properly structured, accurately reflecting the names and qualifications of all individuals mentioned in the input, while preserving the original name formatting and taking into account their position relative to the "previous" keyword.

**Placeholders:**
- `<NAME>` for the individual's name exactly as it appears in the input text.
- `<QUALIFICATION>` for the individual's academic qualifications in short form only (e.g., MD, BS, PhD).

**Instructions:**

1. **Extract Names and Qualifications Relative to 'previous':** Identify all names and their associated qualifications within the text, omitting any university or college names and keeping the original formatting of each name. Only qualifications in the short form are to be considered (e.g., MD, BS, PhD). Pay special attention to the keyword "previous" and categorize the names and qualifications into two parts based on their position relative to this keyword.

2. **Format Using Placeholders and Categorization:** For each identified individual, use the placeholders `<NAME>` and `<QUALIFICATION>` to format their information according to the JSON structure. Ensure no alterations to the names and categorize them as either before or after the "previous" keyword.

3. **JSON Template Structure for Categorized Entries:**
    ```json
    {
      "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION_BEFORE_PREVIOUS": [
        ["<NAME>, <QUALIFICATION>"],
        "... additional entries as needed"
      ],
      "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION_AFTER_PREVIOUS": [
        ["<NAME>, <QUALIFICATION>"],
        "... additional entries as needed"
      ]
    }
    ```

4. **Insert Entries into JSON Template Based on Categorization:** For each extracted name and qualification, replace the corresponding placeholders in the JSON template and place them under the correct category, either before or after the "previous" keyword. Ensure each entry is correctly formatted and maintains the original spelling of the name.

5. **Check and Validate JSON Output:** Review the final JSON output to ensure it is valid and adheres to the intended formatting and categorization. The output should accurately represent the names and qualifications of all identified individuals, maintaining the structure and integrity of the original input and the categorization based on the "previous" keyword.

6. **Avoid Duplicate Names in Each Category:** Ensure that each name is unique within its respective category in the JSON output, not creating duplicate entries within the "before previous" or "after previous" sections. Names should be recorded exactly as they appear in the input text, without any alterations or duplication.

7. **Qualifications in Short Form Only:** Only qualifications expressed in abbreviated forms (e.g., MD, BS, PhD) should be included, excluding any full-form or extended academic titles.

**Few-Shot Examples:**

- **Q:** `Melero Bermejo, Ignacio Immunology specialist, Laboratory specialist, Doctor in Medicine and Surgery, Degree in Medicine, MD(previous)Vaccaro, Gina, Maria B.S., Intern, Internal Medicine, M.D., Resident, Internal Medicine, Fellow, Hematology & Medical Oncology, MD`
  
  **A:**
  ```json
  {
    "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION_BEFORE_PREVIOUS": [
      ["Melero Bermejo, Ignacio", "MD"]
    ],
    "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION_AFTER_PREVIOUS": [
      ["Vaccaro, Gina, Maria", "B.S.", "MD"]
    ]
  }
  ```
