**Input Text:** `[INPUT TEXT]`

Analyze the provided text to separate names and their academic qualifications into two segments based on the keyword 'previous'. Segment A includes entries before 'previous', and Segment B includes entries after 'previous'. Exclude affiliations with universities or colleges, and maintain the original name formatting. Use the below JSON structure, inserting names and qualifications as per the specified format. Ensure the final JSON accurately represents the segmented names and qualifications, preserving the original formatting.

**Placeholders:**
- `<NAME>` for the individual's name as it appears in the input.
- `<QUALIFICATION>` for the academic qualifications in short form (e.g., MD, BS, PhD).

**Instructions:**

1. **Segment Names and Qualifications:** Split the text at 'previous', identifying names and qualifications in each segment, excluding university or college names. Retain original name formatting and consider only short-form qualifications.

2. **Format Using Placeholders:** Format each name and qualification using `<NAME>` and `<QUALIFICATION>` within the JSON structure, ensuring no alterations to the names.

3. **JSON Template Structure for Segmented Entries:**
    ```json
    {
      "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION_BEFORE_PREVIOUS": [
        ["<NAME>, <QUALIFICATION>"],
        "... additional entries as needed"
      ],
      "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION_AFTER_PREVIOUS": [
        ["<NAME>, <QUALIFICATION>"],
        "... additional entries as needed"
      ]
    }
    ```

4. **Insert Entries into JSON Template:** Replace placeholders with actual data in the JSON template for both segments, ensuring correct formatting and original spelling.

5. **Check and Validate JSON Output:** Review the final JSON to ensure it is valid and reflects the segmented names and qualifications accurately.

6. **Ensure Uniqueness and Short-form Qualifications:** Avoid duplicates within segments and include only short-form qualifications.
