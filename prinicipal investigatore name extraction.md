**Input Text:** `[INPUT TEXT]`

Carefully analyze the provided text to extract names along with their academic qualifications, ensuring to exclude any affiliations with universities or colleges. Retain the original formatting and spelling of each name as it appears in the input. Utilize the placeholders and template provided below to format the extracted names and qualifications according to the specified JSON structure. The template is designed to accommodate multiple entries, so ensure each name and its corresponding qualification are correctly formatted and inserted into the JSON template. Confirm that the final JSON output is properly structured, accurately reflecting the names and qualifications of all individuals mentioned in the input, while preserving the original name formatting.

**Placeholders:**
- `<NAME>` for the individual's name exactly as it appears in the input text.
- `<QUALIFICATION>` for the individual's academic qualifications in short form only (e.g., MD, BS, PhD).

**Instructions:**

1. **Extract Names and Qualifications:** Identify all names and their associated qualifications within the text, omitting any university or college names and keeping the original formatting of each name. Only qualifications in the short form are to be considered (e.g., MD, BS, PhD).

2. **Format Using Placeholders:** For each identified individual, use the placeholders `<NAME>` and `<QUALIFICATION>` to format their information according to the JSON structure. Ensure no alterations to the names.

3. **JSON Template Structure for Multiple Entries:**
    ```json
    {
      "NAME_WITH_QUALIFICATION": [
        ["<NAME>, <QUALIFICATION>"],
        ["<NAME>, <QUALIFICATION>"],
        "... additional entries as needed"
      ]
    }
    ```

4. **Insert Multiple Entries into JSON Template:** For each extracted name and qualification, replace the corresponding placeholders in the JSON template. Ensure each entry is correctly formatted and maintains the original spelling of the name.

5. **Check and Validate JSON Output:** Review the final JSON output to ensure it is valid and adheres to the intended formatting. The output should accurately represent the names and qualifications of all identified individuals, maintaining the structure and integrity of the original input.

6. **Avoid Duplicate Names:** Ensure that each name is unique within the JSON output, not creating duplicate entries. Names should be recorded exactly as they appear in the input text, without any alterations or duplication.

7. **Qualifications in Short Form Only:** Only qualifications expressed in abbreviated forms (e.g., MD, BS, PhD) should be included, excluding any full-form or extended academic titles.
