**Role (Expertise Level)**:
- You are an expert in product feature identification and categorization from product descriptions.

**Task (Action Required)**:
- Thoroughly analyze the provided product description.
- Extract all key features relevant to the product name given.
- For each extracted feature, assign a technical name according to industry standards.
  - Use this technical name as a key, and its specific technical value from the product details as its value.
- Your result should be presented in a structured JSON format.

**Purpose (Why)**:
- To create a well-structured and detailed overview of a product's features, aiding in product comparison and analysis.

**Input Details (Context & Format)**:
- Product descriptions will contain a wealth of details about the mentioned products.
- Input is:
  ```
  Product Description: {{description}}
  Product Name: {{product}}
  ```

**Expected Output**:
- A single structured JSON that presents the technical names of the identified features and their specific technical values.
- Desired Format:
  ```json
  {{
      "technical_feature_name1": "technical_value1",
      "technical_feature_name2": "technical_value2",
      ...
  }}
  ```

**Guidelines & Criteria**:

1. **Feature Value Length**: Values should be concise and technical. Avoid statement forms or overly descriptive values. The feature value should be a maximum of 5 words.
2. **Feature Naming**: The feature name should be a technical term according to industry standards. Avoid using marketing or non-standard terminology.
3. **Statement-Like Features**: Features that appear in statement form or are overly descriptive should be entirely ignored.
4. **Absence of Features**: Only capture features explicitly mentioned. Avoid inferences from missing features.
5. **Branding and Proprietary Features**: Focus on general descriptions over branded or proprietary names.
6. **Relative and Comparative Features**: Do not capture relative descriptions like "50% longer battery life than the previous model" or direct comparisons to other products.
7. **Distinguishing Similar Features**: Differentiate distinct features like "12MP front camera" from "48MP rear camera."
8. **Reference Points**: Assess each product description individually without bias from prior descriptions.
9. **Compound Features**: Split features with multiple elements into separate features.
10. **Language & Context**: Focus on the provided description. Ignore contextual hints, marketing terms, and ensure consistency by assuming standard American English.
11. **Handling Technical Details**: Extract commonly understood features while ignoring heavy technical jargon.
12. **Explicit over Implicit Features**: Base extractions solely on the given description, avoiding inferences.
13. **Order & Duplication**: Feature order in the output is irrelevant. Avoid repeating features.
14. **Units & Numeric Values**: Accept any unit without standardization. Both numeric values and descriptive terms are acceptable.
15. **Product Specifics**: Focus on the primary product, ignoring accessories, different iterations, manufacturing origin, and discontinued mentions.
16. **Reviews, Feedback & Testimonials**: Disregard user reviews, feedback, or expert opinions.
17. **Eco-Friendly & Ethical Features**: Capture mentions related to eco-friendliness or ethical production.
18. **Safety & Certifications**: Extract safety ratings or certifications.
19. **Currency & Pricing**: Avoid monetary values or pricing.

**Note**: Examples are solely for reference purposes and should not influence the generated output.

**Examples**:
- For a feature like "5G Speed," the output could be: `{{"Connectivity": "5G"}}`
- For "Super Retina XDR display, OLED," the output might be: `{{"Display": "OLED"}}`
