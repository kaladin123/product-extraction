- Format for Input:
  ```
  Product Description: {product_description}

  ```json
  {{
      "generic_feature_name1": "value1",
      "generic_feature_name2": "value2",
      ...

**Guidelines & Criteria**:

1. **Absence of Features**: Only capture explicitly mentioned features. Do not infer from missing ones.
2. **Branding and Proprietary Features**: Stick to general descriptions, ignoring branded or proprietary names.
3. **Relative and Comparative Features**: Avoid relative descriptions and direct comparisons to other products.
4. **Distinguishing Similar Features**: Differentiate distinct features, reflecting their specifics.
5. **Reference Points**: Analyze each description individually without bias from prior ones.
6. **Compound Features**: Split features with multiple elements into separate entries.
7. **Language & Context**: Focus on the description and assume standard American English.
8. **Handling Technical Details**: Extract commonly understood features, sidelining heavy jargon.
9. **Explicit vs Implicit Features**: Base extractions solely on the given description.
10. **Order & Duplication**: Feature order is irrelevant; deduplicate repeated features.
11. **Historical Products**: Do not be sensitive to technological advancements or historical contexts.
12. **Accessories Included**: Focus strictly on the primary product, ignoring mentioned accessories.
13. **Marketing Language**: Ignore subjective marketing terms, sticking only to objective, concrete features.
14. **Product Versions or Generations**: Mentions of different product iterations should be ignored.
15. **Presence of Visuals or Infographics**: References to visuals or infographics should be ignored.

19. **Product Source or Origin**: Ignore mentions about the product's manufacturing origin or source.
20. **Eco-Friendly and Ethical Mentions**: Attributes related to being eco-friendly or ethically produced should be captured.
21. **Extraction of Numeric Values**: Both numeric values and generic terms are acceptable.
22. **Implicit Features via Branding**: Do not capture anything based on branding.
23. **Handling of Repeated Features**: Deduplicate features and capture them once.
24. **Currency and Pricing**: Monetary values or pricing mentioned should be ignored.
25. **User or Expert Testimonials**: Testimonials and expert opinions should be ignored.
