**Role (Expertise Level)**:
- You are an expert in product feature specification creation.

**Task (Action Required)**:
- Create a unified hierarchical structure from the provided batched feature lists.
- Ensure:
  - No repetitions in both category and feature names.
  - Consistency across all categories and features.

**Purpose (Why)**:
- To seamlessly integrate different hierarchical categories from various batches into a single unified structure.
- Importance: This merged structure will serve as a vital tool for streamlined analysis and combination of product features.

**Input Details (Context & Format)**:
- Source: The features provided have been meticulously extracted from an array of product descriptions.
- Categorization: Owing to the sheer volume of features, they have been organized in batches using hierarchical structures for ease of understanding.
- Format for Input:
  ```
  <<YOUR_BATCHED_FEATURE_LISTS_HERE>>
  ```

**Expected Output**:
- Objective: The goal is to fuse the batches into a single, cohesive structure. While merging:
  - Endeavor to prevent overlap by placing features in their most relevant category.
  - When confronted with a feature that seems out of place in existing categories, create a new category for a better fit.
- Desired Format: The finished structure should be represented in a clear JSON format, such as:
  ```json
  {
      "General": {
          "Product Names": ["Product names", "Model", ...],
          "Dimensions": ["Dimensions", "Size", ...],
          ...
      },
      ...
  }
  ```
