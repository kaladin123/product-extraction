Given the structure of the input data, we need to identify and extract information for two main categories: the study center (referred to as 'Offices' in the input text) and the patient treatment centers. The input text follows a pattern where each section starts with a name followed by an address block. We will break down the task into sequential steps to extract and format this information.

1. **Identify the Study Center Information:**
   - Locate the beginning of the study center information, marked by "Offices:".
   - Extract the name of the study center, which is the line immediately following "Offices:".
   - Identify the address block for the study center and decompose it into:
     - Address 1 and Address 2 (if applicable)
     - City, province, and postal code
     - Country
   - Format this information according to the specified output structure for `office_details`.

2. **Identify Patient Treatment Center Information:**
   - Locate the section starting with "Patient Treatment Centers:".
   - For each treatment center listed:
     - Extract the name of the treatment center, which is the line immediately following "Patient Treatment Center:".
     - Identify the address block for each treatment center and decompose it into:
       - Address 1 and Address 2 (if applicable)
       - City, province, and postal code
       - Country
     - Format this information according to the specified output structure for `patient_details`.

3. **Formatting Details:**
   - Ensure that each piece of information is correctly assigned to its corresponding field in the output JSON structure.
   - Pay attention to inconsistencies or missing information in the input text (e.g., "XX" in the postal code) and handle them appropriately, maintaining the structure's integrity.

4. **Review and Finalize:**
   - After extracting and formatting all the information, review the entire output structure for accuracy and completeness.
   - Ensure that all fields are populated correctly, and the structure matches the specified output format.
